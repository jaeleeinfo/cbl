English is more than a set of grammar rules. Speaking and writing the language requires a sense of the flow of the language; a sense of how it’s used by its native speakers.

The most common example of this is the use of contractions. For instance, combining the phrase “I had” into “I’d,” or the phrase “I will” into “I’ll”. Using the full phrase repeatedly in a conversation will seem overly formal and may sound unnatural.

Another aspect of advanced use of English is figures of speech, those phrases that aren’t meant to be taken literally, but which sometimes express a truth better than a more literal phrase. For instance, the phrase “butterflies in their stomach” is clearly not meant to be taken literally, but it’s a wonderfully expressive way to illustrate the feeling of nervousness that can cause an uneasy feeling in the stomach.

The usage of slang is another cultural aspect of the English language. Slang can be useful in some situations, although it can be easy to overdo it. Slang words and phrases are easy to misinterpret and can become outdated very quickly.

There is only one way to get a sense of the flow of any language, and that is to hear it spoken and to speak it oneself. One can become familiar with all of the rules, and yet still not be aware of those small nuances of how the language is used on an everyday basis.

The important thing to remember is that language is a human creation. While grammar is an important factor of the English language, students must not forget the immense role of culture in the formation of a language. Any language is an expression of the culture that created it. It is a way for members of that culture to share their feelings and experiences. In order to truly be fluent in English, one must learn the interactions between the culture and the language. Students must be immersed in the culture of the language that they are trying to learn. It’s not always easy to learn those things, but it is always a rewarding pursuit.
