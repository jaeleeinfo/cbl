Fast food became a very popular cultural phenomenon in the United States in the decade following World War II.  Quick-service dining had begun in the U.S. with diners and lunch counters in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and with the drive-in restaurants that became popular in the 1920s as automobiles became more popular.  It wasn’t until the 1950s, though, that fast food restaurants in the modern sense were established all across the United States.

The first fast food chain to become successful was McDonald's.  The original McDonald’s was a hamburger stand founded by the brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940 in San Bernardino, CA.  They sold a few franchise rights in 1952 and 1953, but it was when businessman Ray Kroc set up a franchise agreement in 1954 that McDonald’s restaurants began to open all over the United States.  Two Miami businessmen who had visited the original McDonald’s location in San Bernardino founded the Burger King chain in southern Florida in 1953, and in 1956, the owner of Carl’s Drive-In Barbeque opened two fast-food restaurants which he named Carl’s Jr., which soon became another popular brand.  The current owners of Carl’s Jr. also own the Hardee’s chain, which was founded in Greenville, NC in 1960 by Wilber Hardee.  Wendy’s is a relative latecomer to the market, not having been established until 1969.

All through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, fast food was incredibly popular in the United States, and most of the major chains began to expand into other countries.  By the 1990s, however, as people became more aware of the negative effects of an unhealthy diet, the offerings at most fast food restaurants began to lose their appeal to a certain extent.

It was also in the 1990s that “fast casual” chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread became popular.  Like fast food restaurants, they offer quick service, but their fresh ingredients and lower fat content appealed to more health conscious customers.

As a result, the traditional fast food chains began to make changes to their menus to keep up with this trend.  Wendy’s introduced salads in 2002, and both McDonald’s and Wendy’s began using fresh beef for their hamburgers, instead of the frozen beef that they had previously relied upon.  McDonald’s also got rid of their Supersize menu after the documentary "Super Size Me" was released in 2004 and demonstrated how unhealthy its offerings were, and in 2006 they announced that upcoming menu changes would emphasize chicken, salads, and other "fresh foods".  The traditional chains also began closing some underperforming locations, and remodeling other locations to look more upscale, adding features such as fireplaces and comfortable chairs.  It’s currently unknown if this will improve business, though.  Sales at McDonald’s have been decreasing steadily since 2013.

As traditional fast food falls out of favor with Americans, some of the chains have begun to rely on international locations for much of their business.  For instance, according to one blog, 61% of McDonald’s locations are outside of the U.S., compared with 51% of Burger King locations, 50% of Pizza Hut locations, and a surprising 78% of KFC locations.1  McDonald’s international sales rose 5.5% in 2018, in sharp contrast to their sales within the U.S.

American fast food chains that also operate in other nations tailor their menus to local demands. For instance, Domino’s Pizza offers curry as a topping in India, while Pizza Hut offers teriyaki chicken in Japan.  McDonald’s offers the Big Mac everywhere, but also has specialized burgers in Japan, as well as dipping sauces that have more of an Asian flavor profile.
