As someone who has never been fluent in a second language, despite having taken Spanish classes in high school, I can easily understand how difficult it would be to try to communicate with another person in a new language. I have also seen it firsthand, during the five years that I worked at the customer service desk at a university’s bookstore. I had many frustrating conversations with international students who needed my assistance, but who didn’t have the English skills to effectively explain what they needed.

I also understand very well that English is an unusually complicated language to master. In Spanish and other similar European languages, grammar and verb conjugation tend to be standard most of the time. English has rules of grammar and verb conjugation, of course, just like any language, but there are also an intimidatingly large amount of instances where those rules simply do not apply.

When I heard about Bearlingo, I thought that it sounded like a very useful program, because I realize how complex and difficult it is to learn English. I also know, from the experience of taking Spanish classes and yet still not ever becoming fluent in Spanish, that the only way to truly learn a language is to converse with native speakers of that language. Any program that offers that opportunity to people who want to learn English would appear to be very useful, so I agreed to participate.

In my posts on Bearlingo, I’ve tried to keep in mind how complicated English would be to someone who isn’t used to its structure, its inconsistent rules, and how its supposed to sound. The first two of those things can be taught, but the third can only be learned through practice and through the continual experience of hearing spoken English and reading written English. I usually try to write reasonably uncomplicated sentences and to avoid less common words that might be unfamiliar to someone only beginning to learn the language.

However, sometimes I’ve realized that the only way to fully express a thought is through a more complex sentence. Therefore, on a few occasions, I’ve written longer sentences with some words that might be less familiar.

In the future, I want to try to do better in an actual conversation. I’ve realized that a lot of my posts are original comments on the videos, which I suppose isn’t bad, but it’s not the same as an actual conversation.

This was a submission made by one of our mentors.
